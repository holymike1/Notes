<h2>HTML Notez n Stuffz</h2>

	<body>
		<p>Writing < h 1 > < / h 1 > makes a header 
		To tell the browser that you are typing in HTML, < ! doctype html > must be put at the top of the html file 
		Writing < h t m l > after establishing the doctype tells the browser that the following text is in html, it is closed with < / ht m l > 
		So far ive done two things: Declared to the browser that your code is HTML. 
		Added the HTML element (< h t m l >) that will contain the rest of your code. 
		The < h e a d > element is usually put right after the first html tag, it contains metadata 
		Metadata is information about the page that isnt directly displayed on the web page 
		In the < h e a d > element if you add a < t i t l e> element and put text in it, you will change the name of the site 
		The < b o d y > element contains all the writing and images on the webpage, it closes with < / b o d y > 
 <h2> Review </h2> 
		<p>Headings and sub-headings, < h 1 > to < h 6 > tags, are used to enlarge text. 
		< p >, < s p a n > and < d i v > tags specify text or blocks. 
		The < e m > and < s t r o n g > tags are used to emphasize text. 
		Line breaks are created with the < b r > tag. 
		Ordered lists (< o l >) are numbered and unordered lists (< u l >) are bulleted. 
		Images (< i m g >) and videos (< v i d e o >) can be added by linking to an existing source. 
		Anchor tags (< a >) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page. 
		You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using < a > tags and addings ids to the elements you wish to jump to. 
		The nav element contains links to internal pages or content. 
		The < t a b l e > element creates a table. 
		The < t r > element adds rows to a table. 
		To add data to a row, you can use the < t d > element. 
		Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the < t h > element. 
		Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute. 
		Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute. 
		Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer. 
		A table's head is created with the < t h e a d > element. 
		A table's body is created with the < t b o d y > element. 
		A table's footer is created with the < t f o o t > element. 
		All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data. 

<h2> CSS Notez n Stuffz </h2>
		<p>To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. 
		HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the < s t y l e > element. 
		CSS can be written between opening and closing < s t y l e > tags. To use the < s t y l e > element, it must be placed inside of the < h e a d > element. 
		Use the < l i n k > element to link HTML and CSS files together. The < l i n k > element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag 
		and requires the following three attributes: 
		<ul>
			<li>href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file. 
			<li>type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.
			<li>rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.
		</ul>
		<p>In HTML, the tag for a paragraph element is < p >. The CSS syntax for selecting < p > elements is: p {} </br>
		HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. It's also possible to select an element by its class attribute.
		We can add multiple classes to an HTML element's class attribute by separating them with a space. 
		If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely (no matter what classes are applied to the element), we can add an ID to the element. To add an ID to an element, the element needs an id attribute:
		< h 1 id="large-title"> ... < / h 1 > 
		Then, CSS can select HTML elements by their id attribute. To select an id element, CSS prepends the id name with a hashtag (#).
		IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, tags.
		When writing CSS rules, it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.
		This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a .special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:

h1.special {

}
		CSS declarations are structured into property and value pairs.
		The font-family property defines the typeface of an element.
		font-size controls the size of text displayed.
		font-weight defines how thin or thick text is displayed.
		The text-align property places text in the left, right, or center of its parent container.
		Text can have two different color attributes: color and background-color. color defines the color of the text, while background-color defines the color behind the text.
		CSS can make an element transparent with the opacity property.
		CSS can also set the background of an element to an image with the background-image property.
		The box model comprises a set of properties used to create space around and between HTML elements.
		The height and width of a content area can be set in pixels or percentage.
		Borders surround the content area and padding of an element. The color, style, and thickness of a border can be set with CSS properties.
		Padding is the space between the content area and the border. It can be set in pixels or percent.
		Margin is the amount of spacing outside of an element's border.
		Horizontal margins add, so the total space between the borders of adjacent elements is equal to the sum of the right margin of one element and the left margin of the adjacent element.
		Vertical margins collapse, so the space between vertically adjacent elements is equal to the larger margin.
		margin: 0 auto horizontally centers an element inside of its parent content area, if it has a width.
		The overflow property can be set to display, hide, or scroll, and dictates how HTML will render content that overflows its parent's content area.
		The visibility property can hide or show elements.

		<h2>	Review Of The Box Model   </h2>
		<p>In the default box model, box dimensions are affected by border thickness and padding.
		The box-sizing property controls the box model used by the browser.
		The default value of the box-sizing property is content-box.
		The value for the new box model is border-box.
		The border-box model is not affected by border thickness or padding.

			<h2> Colorz	</h2>
		<p>Named colors — there are 147 named colors, which you can review here.
		
		<h3>Hexadecimal or Hex colors</h3>
		<p>Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by "A" to "F".
		<p>Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue and green using hexademical numbers such as #23F41A.
		
		<h3>RGB</h3>
		<p>RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green. 
		<p>RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7, 210, 50).
		
		<h3>HSL</h3>
		<p>HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).
		<p>Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: hsl(200, 20%, 50%).
		<p>You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, a, which is represented as a percentage.
		
		<h2> Typography </h2>
		<p> Typography is the art of arranging text on a page.
		Text can appear in any number of weights, with the font-weight property.
		Text can appear in italics with the font-style property.
		The vertical spacing between lines of text can be modified with the line-height property.
		Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. Sans-Serif fonts do not.
		Fallback fonts are used when a certain font is not installed on a user's computer.
		Google Fonts provides free fonts that can be used in an HTML file with the < l i n k > tag or the @font-face property.
		Local fonts can be added to a document with the @font-face property and the path to the font's source.
		The word-spacing property changes how far apart individual words are.
		The letter-spacing property changes how far apart individual letters are.
		The text-align property changes where text horizontally on a page.</p>
		
		<h2> JavaScript </h2>
		<p>Four essential data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, and null.
		Data is printed, or logged, to the console with console.log().
		Four built-in mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.
		JavaScript associates certain properties with different data types.
		JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.
		Libraries are collections of methods that can be called without an instance.
		You can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */. </p>
