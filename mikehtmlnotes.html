<h2>hello world and jimbo</h2>

writing < h 1 > < / h 1 > makes a header <h1> </h1>
to tell the browser that you are typing in HTML, < ! doctype html > must be put at the top of the html file <h1> </h1>
writing < h t m l > after establishing the doctype tells the browser that the following text is in html, it is closed with < / ht m l > <h1> </h1>
so far ive done two things: Declared to the browser that your code is HTML. <h1> </h1>
Added the HTML element (< h t m l >) that will contain the rest of your code.  <h1> </h1>
the < h e a d > element is usually put right after the first html tag, it contains metadata  <h1> </h1>
metadata is information about the page that isnt directly displayed on the web page  <h1> </h1>
in the < h e a d > element if you add a < t i t l e> element and put text in it, you will change the name of the site  <h1> </h1>
</html>
