<h2>hello world and jimbo</h2>
	<body>
		<p>writing < h 1 > < / h 1 > makes a header</p><br />
		<p>to tell the browser that you are typing in HTML, < ! doctype html > must be put at the top of the html file</p> <br />
		<p>writing < h t m l > after establishing the doctype tells the browser that the following text is in html, it is closed with < / ht m l ></p> <br />
		<p>so far ive done two things: Declared to the browser that your code is HTML.</p> <br />
		<p>Added the HTML element (< h t m l >) that will contain the rest of your code.</p> <br />
		<p>the < h e a d > element is usually put right after the first html tag, it contains metadata</p> <br />
		<p>metadata is information about the page that isnt directly displayed on the web page</p> <br />
		<p>in the < h e a d > element if you add a < t i t l e> element and put text in it, you will change the name of the site</p> <br />
		<p>the < b o d y > element contains all the writing and images on the webpage, it closes with < / b o d y ></p> <br />
		<p> <h3> Review </h3> 
		<p> Headings and sub-headings, < h 1 > to < h 6 > tags, are used to enlarge text.</p> <br />
< p >, < s p a n > and < d i v > tags specify text or blocks.</p> <br />
The < e m > and < s t r o n g > tags are used to emphasize text.</p> <br />
Line breaks are created with the < b r > tag.</p> <br />
Ordered lists (< o l >) are numbered and unordered lists (< u l >) are bulleted.</p> <br />
Images (< i m g >) and videos (< v i d e o >) can be added by linking to an existing source.</p> <br />
Anchor tags (< a >) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.</p> <br />
You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using < a > tags and addings ids to the elements you wish to jump to.</p> <br />
The nav element contains links to internal pages or content.</p> <br />
The < t a b l e > element creates a table.</p> <br />
The < t r > element adds rows to a table.</p> <br />
To add data to a row, you can use the < t d > element.</p> <br />
Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the < t h > element.</p> <br />
Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.</p> <br />
Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.</p> <br />
Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.</p> <br />
A table's head is created with the < t h e a d > element.</p> <br />
A table's body is created with the < t b o d y > element.</p> <br />
A table's footer is created with the < t f o o t > element.</p> <br />
All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.</p> <br />
