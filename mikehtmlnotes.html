<h2>HTML Notez n Stuffz</h2>
	<body>
		<p>writing < h 1 > < / h 1 > makes a header<br />
		<p>to tell the browser that you are typing in HTML, < ! doctype html > must be put at the top of the html file <br />
		<p>writing < h t m l > after establishing the doctype tells the browser that the following text is in html, it is closed with < / ht m l > <br />
		<p>so far ive done two things: Declared to the browser that your code is HTML. <br />
		<p>Added the HTML element (< h t m l >) that will contain the rest of your code. <br />
		<p>the < h e a d > element is usually put right after the first html tag, it contains metadata <br />
		<p>metadata is information about the page that isnt directly displayed on the web page <br />
		<p>in the < h e a d > element if you add a < t i t l e> element and put text in it, you will change the name of the site <br />
		<p>the < b o d y > element contains all the writing and images on the webpage, it closes with < / b o d y > <br />
		<p> <h3> Review </h3> 
		<p> Headings and sub-headings, < h 1 > to < h 6 > tags, are used to enlarge text. <br />
		<p>< p >, < s p a n > and < d i v > tags specify text or blocks. <br />
		<p>The < e m > and < s t r o n g > tags are used to emphasize text. <br />
		<p>Line breaks are created with the < b r > tag. <br />
		<p>Ordered lists (< o l >) are numbered and unordered lists (< u l >) are bulleted. <br />
		<p>Images (< i m g >) and videos (< v i d e o >) can be added by linking to an existing source. <br />
		<p>Anchor tags (< a >) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page. <br />
		<p>You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using < a > tags and addings ids to the elements you wish to jump to. <br />
		<p>The nav element contains links to internal pages or content. <br />
		<p>The < t a b l e > element creates a table. <br />
		<p>The < t r > element adds rows to a table. <br />
		<p>To add data to a row, you can use the < t d > element. <br />
		<p>Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the < t h > element. <br />
		<p>Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute. <br />
		<p>Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute. <br />
		<p>Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer. <br />
		<p>A table's head is created with the < t h e a d > element. <br />
		<p>A table's body is created with the < t b o d y > element. <br />
		<p>A table's footer is created with the < t f o o t > element. <br />
		<p>All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data. <br />

<h2> CSS Notez n Stuffz </h2>
		<p>To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. <br />
		<p>HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the < s t y l e > element. <br />
		<p>CSS can be written between opening and closing < s t y l e > tags. To use the < s t y l e > element, it must be placed inside of the < h e a d > element. <br />
		<p>Use the < l i n k > element to link HTML and CSS files together. The < l i n k > element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag <br />
		<p>and requires the following three attributes: <br />
		<ul>
			<li>href — like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file. <br />
			<li>type — this attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.<br />
			<li>rel — this attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.<br />
		</ul>
		<p>In HTML, the tag for a paragraph element is < p >. The CSS syntax for selecting < p > elements is: <br />
p { <br />
<br />
}
		<p>HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. It's also possible to select an element by its class attribute.<br />
		<p>We can add multiple classes to an HTML element's class attribute by separating them with a space. <br />
		<p>If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely (no matter what classes are applied to the element), we can add an ID to the element. To add an ID to an element, the element needs an id attribute:<br />

		<p>< h 1 id="large-title"> ... < / h 1 > <br />
		<p>Then, CSS can select HTML elements by their id attribute. To select an id element, CSS prepends the id name with a hashtag (#).<br />
		<p>IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, tags.<br />
		<p>When writing CSS rules, it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.<br />
		<p>This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a .special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:<br />

h1.special {

}
